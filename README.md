# Budgeting App named Charmed
Created with CodeSandbox

Final Project for Front-End Development Course with General Assembly August 2021

Ths app was initially developed before my knowlege of React and Angular; it was a way to learn Vanilla JS.

## How It Works

The first screen is where you set your budget. Setting your budget is based on a 0-budget principle, where all your budgets should be equal to your income.

Screen two is where you set your transactions based on the budgets you set on the previous screen

Screen three is the result of the calculations. You will see where you are on each budget, how much you have left to spend, or where you have over spent.
